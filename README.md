## Introduction ##
These are code I wrote for solving some NP complete problems using algorithms that I learned from a course on discrete optimization.

### The problems (and algorithms used) include: ###
knapsack problem (depth-first search, branch and bound),
traveling salesman problem (simulated annealing),
facility location problem (mixed integer programming with SCIP MIP solver),
and vehicle routing problem (simulated annealing).
