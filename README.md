Introduction
These are code I wrote for solving some NP complete problems using algorithms that I learned from a course on discrete optimization.

The problems (and algorithms used) include:
knapsack/ - knapsack problem (depth-first search, branch and bound)
tsp/ - traveling salesman problem (simulated annealing)
facility/ - facility location problem (mixed integer programming with SCIP MIP solver)
vrp/ - vehicle routing problem (simulated annealing)
