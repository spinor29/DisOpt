## Introduction ##
This depo contains code I wrote for solving several NP complete problems using algorithms that I learned from Pascal Van Hentenryck's discrete optimization course.

### The problems (and algorithms used) include: ###
Knapsack problem (depth-first search, branch and bound),
traveling salesman problem (simulated annealing),
facility location problem (mixed integer programming with SCIP MIP solver),
and vehicle routing problem (simulated annealing).
