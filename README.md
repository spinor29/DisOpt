This repository contains code I wrote for solving several NP complete problems using algorithms that I learned from Pascal Van Hentenryck's discrete optimization course.

The problems (and algorithms used) include: 

1. Knapsack problem (depth-first search, branch and bound)

2. Traveling salesman problem (simulated annealing)

3. Facility location problem (mixed integer programming with SCIP MIP solver)

4. Vehicle routing problem (simulated annealing).
